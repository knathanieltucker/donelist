## Manifesto 
Donelist (the name should and will change) says it. The real gist of the idea is to make a donelist. Not a todo list or something that tracks your progress. Nor is it a blog really. This should not be a twitter. It should be more formal than that. This is also not a resume or linkedin (though maybe is closest to this). This is somewhere between all these things. 

I want to feel comfortable posting what I recently did at work and allowing my team to see it. I want to feel comfortable posting a personal project here and letting recruiters or friends see how cool it is. I want to feel comfortable using this to store all of the books I have read, and stories I have written, and ML papers I have ingested. 

I want to only let my team see some. I want some to be lumped together and published to the world. And others I want to have as private lists. 

This should be the some total of what I have done. My accomplishments. Projects I have completed. A donelist.
